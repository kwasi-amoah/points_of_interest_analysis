# points_of_interest_analysis
This repository contains notebooks used in my points of interest analysis.
As part of my internship with the Data & Analytics department of a bank in Ghana, I was tasked to identify points of interests(POIs) in Accra and then determine the distance between these POIs and the bank's branches or ATMs. I used various tools to complete this task; excel, python and Power BI. First of all, the bank's branches and ATMs were collated manually from the bank's website because using a python script was not returning all the available branches and ATMs. The collated branches and ATMs were then run through a python script with the aim of identifying their coordinates using the appropriate python libraries. The POIs were also collated using python through the overpass API. The distance between the locations was the calculated using a python script again. The notebooks used for these have been made available in this repository. The generated excel file was exported to Power BI, where this data was visualised. Attached below is a google drive link that contains the excel files and the power BI dashboards.
